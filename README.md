# halp-backend
Server-side code for Halp.

Written in Python3 using Flask. This is backend code for the app Halp, work
is still being done on it. See the issues tab for all future changes / bug fixes.

This code was done for a class at Cal Poly and we weren't allowed to use ORMs
so SQL code is done in Python. This is coupled with a MySQL database MariaDB.
